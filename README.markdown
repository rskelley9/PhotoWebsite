## About this App

This application is a complete photography website, built with CMS and administrator functionality for adding photo, text and video content. It also includes a modest booking system, and its admin interface makes integrating a marketing platform relatively simple.  

This application was built with [Grokphoto.com](http://grokphoto.org/) and the [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/tree/v3.2) engine. The user interface is designed with a customized Rails template.

### GrokPhoto

### Landing Page with Backstretch JS

Landing page is located at app/views/home/welcome-page.html.erb and layout at app/views/layouts/welcome-layout.html.erb. The background is set as a slideshow with Backstretch JQuery script located in the layout file. More options for configuring [Backstretch](http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/).

### Devise

Devise is a flexible authentication solution for Rails based on Warden. It is a Rack-based, complete MVC solution that employs a Rails engine. Devise allows you to have multiple models signed in at the same time and is focused on modularity.

### Software Requirements and Dependencies

## Getting Started

Initialize the database by running the following commands in your terminal:

    rake db:create
    rake db:migrate
    rake db:seed

### Initial Configuration

1. Start your server: rails s
2. Login to the admin panel ('/admin') using email: email@example.com and password: default
3. Click on the Settings tab and enter your own information.

### Blog Setup

You may link your own blog through the Settings tab in the Admin Panel. If you leave it blank, Grokphoto provides a default Markdown posting system.

### Post with Markdown

Posts published via the Admin Panel can be formatted using Markdown. For documentation and syntax help, visit [DaringFireball.com](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

## Notice

Most of the view templates are written in HAML, however there is a branch dedicated to converting the views to ERB to help encourage front-end design without excluding contributors not familiar with Ruby.

## Heroku Deployment

    heroku create --stack cedar
    git push heroku master

Before you seed the database you'll need to setup an amazon s3 account and bucket to have somewhere to store the files. Heroku has a temporary filesystem which is not an appropriate place to store images.

* Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home
* Create a bucket
* Go to: https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/account/index.html
* Click on the Security Credentials in the left nav, then the Access Credentials in the body.
* Copy your S3 key and your S3 secret key

Use your S3 information to fill in the config vars for heroku, then seed the database.

    heroku config:add S3_KEY=change_to_your_amazon_s3_key S3_SECRET=change_to_your_amazon_s3_secret S3_BUCKET=change_to_your_amazon_s3_bucket

You still need to specify a secret token and session store key:

    rake secret
    heroku config:add SESSION_KEY=_usually_your_app_name SECRET_TOKEN=_result_of_rake_secret

To specify the email address to use when the system sends emails:

    heroku config:add SENDER_EMAIL=_your_email_address

To specify the email host to use when the system sends emails:

    heroku config:add EMAIL_HOST=yourdomain.com

To specify an environment specific pepper to use when encrypting passwords:

    rake secret
    heroku config:add DEVISE_PEPPER=_result_of_rake_secret

You can check to make sure all of your heroku environment variables have been properly by listing them:

    heroko config

Once done, migrate and seed the database and launch the app.

    heroku run rake db:migrate
    heroku run rake db:seed

Make sure you also enable memcached on heroku with the below command.

	heroku addons:add memcache:5mb

Open up your shiny new GrokPhoto instance!

    heroku open

Don't forget to change your admin password using the "Forgot my password" feature.



## Tests
